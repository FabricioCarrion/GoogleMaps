# GoogleMaps
Show Multiple Overlays on Google Maps
Simple Javascript code to show multiple overlays. This script allows to customize Google Maps to show markers at different positions. In my script I have taken source and destination and have shown route as well as Overlays (Markers) using Lat Lng. 

Since my source and destination were near so I didn't use Database to store coordinates and fetched them. I have used simple static array. If you have multiple lat longs then you need to fetch coordinates from database and store in array.
