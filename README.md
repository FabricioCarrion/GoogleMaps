# GoogleMaps
Show Multiple Overlays on Google Maps
Simple Javascript code to show multiple overlays. This script allows us to customize Google Maps to show markers at different positions. In my script I have taken source and destination and have shown route as well as Overlays (Markers) using Lat Lng. 

Since my source and destination were near so I didn't use Database to store coordinates. I have used simple static array, if you have multiple coordinates then you need to fetch them from database and store them in array.
